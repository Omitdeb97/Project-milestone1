            A Setup Information file (an INF file) is a plain-text file used by
            Windows for the installation of software and drivers. Windows 7
            saves local copies of all drivers that you install in a folder
            called FileRepository. The full path is
            C:WindowsSystem32DriverStoreFileRepository.

            After a configuration pass is processed, Windows Setup annotates the
            cached answer file to indicate that the pass has been processed. If
            the configuration pass is run again and the cached answer file has
            not been replaced or updated in the interim, the answer file
            settings are not processed again. Instead, Windows Setup will search
            for implicit Unattend.xml files that are at a lower precedence
            location than the cached Unattend.xml file. For example, you can
            install Windows with an answer file that contains
            Microsoft-Windows-Deployment/RunSynchronous commands in the
            specialize configuration pass. During installation, the specialize
            configuration pass runs and the RunSynchronous commands execute.
            After installation, run the sysprep command with the /generalize
            option. If there is no answer file in a higher precedence than the
            cached answer file or an answer file was not explicitly passed to
            the Sysprep tool, Setup runs the specialize configuration pass the
            next time that the computer boots. Because the cached answer file
            contains an annotation that the settings for that configuration pass
            were already applied, the RunSynchronous commands do not execute.
